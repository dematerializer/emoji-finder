# emoji-quickfinder

## TODO
- test data.js
- data.js => try english as a fallback before taking the name as the last resort (unicode-emoji-data should take care that information is complete via community annotations)
- read out and use currently set language from shell environment for annotations
- offer language selection?
- add history functionality with up/down arrow keys for single emoji input
- make this module be usable as a library and a cli
